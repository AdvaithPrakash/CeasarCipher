# 🟩 Variable Caesar Cipher - Web App

A sleek, retro-themed web app that encrypts messages using a **random Caesar shift per character**. Built to mimic an old-school terminal, this project combines cryptography with classic green-on-black UI aesthetics.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Encrypt** messages with a random shift for every character
- 🧠 **Decrypt** messages using the stored shift key
- 📋 **Copy buttons** for message and key outputs
- 💾 **Fully client-side** (no backend, works offline)
- 🖥️ **Retro terminal look** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Choose **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**
2. Type your message
3. In **Encrypt** mode:
   - A random Caesar shift is applied to each letter
   - The app outputs the encrypted message + the shift key
4. In **Decrypt** mode:
   - Paste your encrypted message
   - Paste the shift key (comma-separated)
   - The original message is revealed

## 🎓 Why I Built This

I created this as a fun, interactive way to explore:
- 🔤 Caesar cipher logic with a twist (randomized shift)
- 🖱 DOM manipulation and user interaction
- 🎨 Retro UI design using pure CSS
- 🧪 Usable and testable tools with no dependencies

## 📘 What I Learned from This Project

This project gave me hands-on experience with both **programming fundamentals** and **user interface design**. Here's what I took away:

### 🔤 Cryptography & Logic
- Implemented the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm from scratch
- Modified it to use **variable shift values per character**
- Learned how to build a **custom encryption/decryption logic**

### 🧠 JavaScript Skills
- Manipulated strings and characters with `.charCodeAt()` and `.fromCharCode()`
- Used **arrays and loops** to track encryption keys
- Dynamically updated the DOM with JavaScript
- Wrote functions that adapt based on **user input**

### 🎨 Front-End Web Development
- Created a fully functional app using **just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Designed a **retro terminal UI** using green-on-black styling
- Handled **form inputs**, **copy-to-clipboard**, and **animated output**

### 🛠 Project Management
- Broke the app into versions and **iterated gradually**
- Practiced clean code structure, readability, and UX consistency
- Learned how to present and document a project for **portfolio and GitHub**

This was a great learning experience that strengthened both my **technical problem-solving**.


## 💡 Future Ideas

- 🔑 Passphrase-based cipher (like Vigenère)
- 📄 Upload and decrypt `.txt` files
- 🧠 Brute-force cracker with English detection
- 🌓 Theme toggle: Retro ↔ Modern
